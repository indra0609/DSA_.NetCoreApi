### LINQ

```csharp
var ids = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3 };
var result = employees
    .Where(e => ids.Contains(e.Id))
    .ToList();
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Id IN (1,2,3);
```

---

### LINQ

```csharp
var result = employees
    .Where(e => e.Name.StartsWith("A"))
    .ToList();
```

SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Name LIKE 'A%';
```

---

## 7. ORDER BY

### LINQ

```csharp
var result = employees
    .OrderBy(e => e.Name)
    .ToList();

ORDER BY Name ASC;
```

---

## 8. ORDER BY multiple columns

### LINQ

var result = employees
    .OrderBy(e => e.Department)
    .ThenByDescending(e => e.Salary)
    .ToList();
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
ORDER BY Department ASC, Salary DESC;
```

---

## 9. COUNT

### LINQ

```csharp
int count = employees.Count();
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees;
```

---

## 10. GROUP BY

### LINQ

```csharp
var result = employees
    .GroupBy(e => e.Department)
    .Select(g => new
    {
        Department = g.Key,
        Count = g.Count()
    });
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS Count
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department;
```

---

## 11. HAVING clause

### LINQ

```csharp
var result = employees
    .GroupBy(e => e.Department)
    .Where(g => g.Count() > 5)
    .Select(g => new
    {
        Department = g.Key,
        Count = g.Count()
    });
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS Count
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

---

## 12. MAX / MIN

### LINQ

```csharp
var maxSalary = employees.Max(e => e.Salary);
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employees;
```

---

## 13. TOP N records

### LINQ

```csharp
var result = employees
    .OrderByDescending(e => e.Salary)
    .Take(3)
    .ToList();
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT TOP 3 *
FROM Employees
ORDER BY Salary DESC;
```

---

## 14. INNER JOIN

### LINQ

```csharp
var result = employees.Join(departments,
    e => e.DepartmentId,
    d => d.Id,
    (e, d) => new
    {
        e.Name,
        DepartmentName = d.Name
    });
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT e.Name, d.Name AS DepartmentName
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d
ON e.DepartmentId = d.Id;
```

---

## 15. LEFT JOIN (VERY IMPORTANT)

### LINQ

```csharp
var result = from e in employees
             join d in departments
             on e.DepartmentId equals d.Id into gj
             from sub in gj.DefaultIfEmpty()
             select new
             {
                 e.Name,
                 Department = sub != null ? sub.Name : null
             };
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT e.Name, d.Name AS Department
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Departments d
ON e.DepartmentId = d.Id;
```

---

## 16. EXISTS

### LINQ

```csharp
bool exists = employees.Any(e => e.Salary > 100000);
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT CASE 
WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Employees WHERE Salary > 100000)
THEN 1 ELSE 0 END;
```

---

## 17. Pagination

### LINQ

```csharp
var result = employees
    .Skip(10)
    .Take(5)
    .ToList();
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employees
ORDER BY Id
OFFSET 10 ROWS
FETCH NEXT 5 ROWS ONLY;
```

---

## 18. DISTINCT

### LINQ

```csharp
var result = employees
    .Select(e => e.Department)
    .Distinct();
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Department FROM Employees;
```

---

## 19. NULL check

### LINQ

```csharp
var result = employees
    .Where(e => e.ManagerId == null)
    .ToList();
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE ManagerId IS NULL;
```

---

## 20. Subquery (Salary > Average)

### LINQ

```csharp
var avgSalary = employees.Average(e => e.Salary);

var result = employees
    .Where(e => e.Salary > avgSalary)
    .ToList();
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);
```

# ⭐ INTERVIEW GOLD QUESTIONS (VERY IMPORTANT)

❓ **When to use LINQ vs SQL?**

* LINQ → business logic, readability, maintainability
* SQL → heavy data, reporting, performance-critical queries

❓ **Which is faster?**

* Raw SQL is usually faster for complex queries
* LINQ is translated to SQL by EF (depends on query quality)

❓ **Common LINQ performance mistake**

* Calling `ToList()` too early
* Filtering after fetching data
